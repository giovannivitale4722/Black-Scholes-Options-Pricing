<h1>Assumptions</h1>
<p1> The Black-Scholes model is based on a risk-neutral valuation and assumes that the price of the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion. The geometric Brownian motion assumes that the logarithm of the asset's price follows a normal distribution.</p1>
<br><br> 
The model assumes there is a constant risk-free interest rate. Investors typically use the yields of governemnt bonds that reflect a similar time horizon. Bond rates can change weekly or even daily due to market conditions, policy decisions, and investor sentiment.
